# ASM
I did it! I made more than one ASM hack!

## FE7_InlineHacks
Small FE7 hacks that can be directly inserted without needing to be hooked:  

* Multiple S Ranks: Allows for more than one S weapon rank

## FE8_NoPromotionBonus:
Removes the promotion exp bonus from exp calcs

## FE8_DismountMount (With terrain check):
Terrain check addon for CrazyColorz' DismountMount hack.  
Prevents mounting or dismounting if the other class cannot navigate that tile.

## FE8_BattleCritCap
Caps battle crit at 100 so you won't have a 110% chance to crit someone.

## NoBallistaCanto:
Disables units on ballistae from using canto, even if they have the skill  
(FE8 version not compatible with Skillsystems. It's already built in)
